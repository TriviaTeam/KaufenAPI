# Kaufen API


# Getting started

Before anything, you need to install [docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/). After installing those, you'll be able to start contributing to this project.

# Starting the application

It's as easy as:

```bash
$ make build
```
And then

```bash
$ make up
```

This will start a fresh new application

To load sample data for the database, run:

```bash
$ make loaddata
```
